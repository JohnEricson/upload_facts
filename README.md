# upload_facts
Uploads yaml files with facts to PuppetDB. These yaml-files are in the same format as when created by the Puppet Master when real agents report their facts in the beginning of a Puppet Agent execution. Developed for copying facts from old Puppet Master to new Puppet Master when upgrading Puppet version.
